# LGSVL Image and Point Cloud Saver Tool

This is a utility tool that allows recording video, taking image samples at required frequency, saving point cloud data and also recording point cloud data by taking 
samples at specified frequencies using PythonAPI for LGSVL.

## How to use
1. Install LGSVL (you can use spark_setup repository)
2. Add the latest map from `simulation_utils` by naming it as `Teknofest-1.1`
3. Run the script.

## Current Progress
* Image and point cloud saving ability is implemented
* A simple UI using Tkinter is added
* __Threading problem needs to be fixed__
* __Recording and getting images at intervals ability needs to be implemented__
